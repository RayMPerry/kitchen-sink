# The Kitchen Sink
> "I tried everything but the kitchen sink." - Someone, somewhere.

This repository contains experiments, oddities, and other such scripts that spawned from a foray into a language. (Mostly) comprised of JavaScript, Haxe, and Lisp/Scheme, I plan on using this repo to post my findings and learnings from other languages.

### Languages I Like

#### Dynamically-typed, gradual-typed
- **JavaScript:** :star: Obviously.
- **TypeScript:** Yep.
- **Perl 6:** :+1: This language is nutty and I enjoy making terse expressions with it. This also suffers from slowness. Hopefully, the next few changes to Rakudo will change that.

#### Statically-typed
- **Haxe:** :star: The documentation is a bit sparse and scattered about but, this has serious merit and can be used to get 80% to 90% of the application off the ground.
- **D:** Love it. Very productive language. Needs a killer app to bring it back into relevance.

#### Lisp/Scheme
- **Common Lisp:** :star: I didn't like this at first but I'm starting to like it now.
- **Emacs Lisp:** A necessity since I use Emacs.
- **Racket:** :+1: Love this. It feels right but it's a bit slow. Hopefully, Racket-on-Chez will change the game.
