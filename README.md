# The Kitchen Sink
> "I tried everything but the kitchen sink." - Someone, somewhere.

This repository contains experiments, oddities, and other such scripts that spawned from a foray into a language. (Mostly) comprised of JavaScript, Haxe, and Lisp/Scheme, I plan on using this repo to post my findings and learnings from other languages.

### Languages I Like

#### Dynamically-typed, gradual-typed
- **JavaScript:** :star: Obviously.
- **Perl 6:** :+1: This language is nutty and I enjoy making terse expressions with it. This also suffers from slowness. Hopefully, the next few changes to Rakudo will change that.
- **Tcl:** I wrote a good amount of this in the beginning but, it suffered when trying to move scripts from place to place. I didn't want to make starkits for each script and building up a proper environment per OS kinda blows.
- **Lua:** It's Lua. I like the language but it's super spartan.

#### Statically-typed
- **Haxe:** :star: The documentation is a bit sparse and scattered about but, this has serious merit and can be used to get 80% to 90% of the application off the ground.
- **D:** :+1: Love it. Very productive language. Needs a killer app to bring it back into relevance.
- **OCaml:** :+1: I've taken a new interest in this language since I've fixed my tooling issues. I like this a lot. 
- **Red:** I appreciate this language and I want it to succeed. Suffers from lack of 64-bit support and `view` dialect support on Linux.

#### Lisp/Scheme
- **Emacs Lisp:** :star: A necessity since I use Emacs.
- **Common Lisp:** :+1: I didn't like this at first but I'm starting to like it now.
- **Racket:** It feels right but it's a bit slow. Hopefully, Racket-on-Chez will change the game.
- **Gambit Scheme:** Love the speed of this but the package management systems leave something to be desired.
