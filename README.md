# The Kitchen Sink
> "I tried everything but the kitchen sink." - Someone, somewhere.

This repository contains experiments, oddities, and other such scripts that spawned from a foray into a language. (Mostly) comprised of JavaScript, Haxe, and Lisp/Scheme, I plan on using this repo to post my findings and learnings from other languages.

### Languages I Like
- **JavaScript:** Obviously.
- **TypeScript:** Yep.
- **Haxe:** The documentation is a bit sparse and scattered about but, this has serious merit and can be used to get 80 - 90% of the application off the ground.
- **Common Lisp:** I didn't like this at first but I'm starting to like it now.
- **Emacs Lisp:** A necessity since I use Emacs.
- **Racket:** Love this. It feels right but it's a bit slow. Hopefully, Racket-on-Chez will change the game.
- **Perl 6:** This language is nutty and I enjoy making terse expressions with it. This also suffers from slowness. Hopefully, the next few changes to Rakudo will change that.
